# IcX-Toolbox-Public-Beta
IcX Toolbox is a toolbox that was made for a bunch of different things. IcX Toolbox uses Powershell and CMD commands to send signals to trigger computer sequences, Download other tools online, And more!
This toolbox is still in development so not everything is 100% perfect yet. So do keep that in mind.

We are also trying to fix the toolbox to where Windows will run the program with no problems mainly because as of right now for some stupid reason Windows thinks its a virus. I don't know why but yea.
This program is IN NO WAY MALICIOUS! So until we fix that issues with windows just ignore the windows popup it gives you when running this program
